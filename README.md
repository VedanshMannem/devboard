This project contains all the files of my very own devboard. This devboard is great for engineering and hobbyists, and comes with silkscreen art as well as added LEDs. 

There's two separate BOMs (one in root and one in ProjectFiles), both of which basically just say the same thing. I'm also working on different edge cuts to make it more fun!

Here's some photos:

Overall, learned a ton because this was my first full scale PCB project. Thanks for reading!
